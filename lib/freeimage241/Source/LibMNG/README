libmng 1.0.1
------------

First maintenance release!

There's been some changes in the CMS profile handling, that should make it
easier for sRGB-compliant systems. Non-sRGB compliant systems will still need
some extra work if they want to use MNG_FULL_CMS with lcms. But this has always
been so, so it's not an extra step anyway.
(Many thanks to Marti, Ivan & Warwick for their help & comments!)

Gregg Kelly has been helpful in locating a couple of memory-leaks, and make
the library even better.

The default Windows DLL that's part of the Windows zip-files now also exports
the JPEG library function calls (ijgsrc6b). Note that there's a new Delphi
component (TNGImage) that makes it a snap to work with PNG/JNG & MNG images
within Delphi.

Please enjoy!
