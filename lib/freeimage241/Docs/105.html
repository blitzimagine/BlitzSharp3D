<p>FreeImageQt is the binding of the DLL to TrollTech's Qt library. Qt is a sophisticated c++ programming framework for Windows and Unix, used primarily for the creation of graphical user interface.

<p>Qt provides several objects used to deal with graphics. The most interesting objects to FreeImage are Qimage and QimageIO, because these are the objects that FreeImage hooks. By hooking these two objects, FreeImage provides its enormous list of supported bitmap types to Qt, while keeping the generic interface for loading bitmaps in that library intact. As a Qt programmer you won't notice that you are using FreeImage. And that is the strength of it.
